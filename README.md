# HTML-CSS-Introduction
My first 6 week long introductory class to HTML + CSS. This is my individual assignment.

2021-11-02: Day 2 of coding. 
Checking out what I can do with CSS animations. I added a carousel with automatic image slider and a fadein hover effect for the rounded images on the index page.

I switched the ugly carousel images for solid colors after the reggae flag pallette that I put at -30 saturation. I also changed the carousel caption font. I put my navbar in with a little hover effect and three extra pages because I need more content to mess with with my code. I also switched the off-white background to a warmer color for the eye. I also played some with changing the other headings, and adjusting the image sizes overall.
